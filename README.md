## i3

## polybar

- panels theme from: https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes 
	- just add the *brightnessctl* and *arch-updates* scripts and replace the *config.ini* file
- arch-updates module: https://forum.archlabslinux.com/t/polybar-missing-icons-after-new-install/4086/4

## xbindkeys

I was forced to use xbindkeys just because I wasn't able to make the Super_L key work with i3 as a standalone key to launch the polybar "start" menu
